Visualize satellite ground paths for arbitrary parameters.

I find the paths which satellites trace on the sphere of the earth during the course of their orbits to be rather fascinating. While I have seen many places online where you can view the ground paths for various satellites, I was never able to provide arbitrary orbital elements to see their affect on a satellite's ground path. I'm not really sure what the audience is for this, but I found it interesting.

Calculations are handled by [SGP4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_perturbations_models) via [node-sgp4](https://github.com/joshuaferrara/node-sgp4).

Have fun.
